# 🚀 Production Deployment Security Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### 🔐 Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Change `JWT_SECRET` to a strong random 32+ character string
- [ ] Change `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a strong random string
- [ ] Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your production domain
- [ ] Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your actual domain(s)
- [ ] Set `SOCKET_ORIGINS` to your actual domain(s)
- [ ] Change default admin credentials (`ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

### 🗄️ Database Security
- [ ] Verify Neon PostgreSQL connection string is correct
- [ ] Ensure database has proper backup configuration
- [ ] Confirm SSL/TLS is enabled (sslmode=require)
- [ ] Rotate database credentials if needed

### 🔒 Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Admin passwords are hashed (run `npm run admin:create` with strong password)
- [ ] No plain text passwords in production database
- [ ] JWT tokens have proper expiration (currently 7 days)
- [ ] Admin routes are properly protected

### 🌐 CORS & Network Security
- [ ] CORS origins restricted to your domain only
- [ ] Socket.IO origins restricted to your domain only
- [ ] No wildcard (*) CORS origins in production
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (handled by hosting platform)

### 📝 Production Environment
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` set
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately
- [ ] Security headers are active
- [ ] Error logging configured (consider adding Sentry)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy production template
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   
   # Edit with your actual values
   nano .env.production
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Generate Prisma client for production
   npm run db:generate
   
   # Push schema to production database
   npm run db:push
   
   # Create admin user with secure credentials
   npm run admin:create
   ```

3. **Build & Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Build for production
   npm run build
   
   # Start production server
   npm run start
   ```

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### ✅ SECURE (Already Implemented)
- JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection via Prisma
- XSS protection headers
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)

### 🔄 CONFIGURABLE (Needs Production Values)
- CORS origins (currently uses environment variable)
- Admin credentials (use strong passwords)
- JWT secrets (must be changed for production)

### 🚨 POTENTIAL RISKS (Mitigated)
- ~~Plain text password fallback~~ (Fixed: disabled in production)
- ~~Hardcoded CORS domains~~ (Fixed: uses environment variables)
- ~~Default admin credentials~~ (Configurable via environment)

## 📋 Production Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Error Tracking**: Consider adding Sentry or similar
2. **Database Monitoring**: Monitor Neon PostgreSQL metrics
3. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor for abuse patterns
4. **SSL/TLS**: Ensure certificates are valid and auto-renewing
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

## 🛡️ Post-Deployment Security

- [ ] Verify all admin routes require authentication
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Confirm CORS headers are restrictive
- [ ] Check error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity

## 🔧 Emergency Procedures

If compromised:
1. Immediately rotate JWT_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_SECRET
2. Force logout all users (JWT rotation handles this)
3. Check database for unauthorized changes
4. Review server logs for breach indicators
5. Update admin passwords
